This repository contains the code examples used in the blog post [Demystifying the -fPIC Flag: Understanding Position Independent Code with Examples](https://gabref.github.io/blog/posts/demystifying-the-fpic-flag-understanding-position-independent-code-with-examples/).

## Overview

The blog post explains the concept of Position Independent Code (PIC) and demonstrates the differences between code compiled with and without the `-fPIC` flag. This repository includes the example code snippets and the corresponding assembly code to illustrate these differences.

## Usage

To generate the assembly code yourself, you can just run the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will generate the assembly code for both the `-fPIC` and non-`-fPIC` versions of the code. You can then compare the two assembly files to see the differences in the generated code.

## Blog Post
